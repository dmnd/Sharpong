Sharpong
--------

A crappier pong clone in F#. Inspired by [pongell][1]. Public domain.

The code is probably completely unidiomatic (it uses lots of state), but F# is 
a multi-paradigm language so I can get away with it. Seriously, if you want to 
offer feedback, I'd be glad to hear it. This was a learning exercise.
